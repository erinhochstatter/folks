# Folks

Finding a practical reason for playing with SVGs. It is very VERY WIP, and is a repetitive hot mess. 

This is a react app running on Vite , and you can start it up, by running 
```
npm install -g vite
yarn install
vite dev
```

TODOs:

  [ ] export as many features for reuse from existing .ai files
  [ ] create components, shape constants for each export</li>
  [ ] import the 'focused' colors from the website & branding materials
  
  [ ] determine which filters are turbulence filtered, which are solid,
    which have outlines
  
  [ ] determine defaults for 'neutrals' (e.g. teeth, eyewhites, shirts,
    orbs)
  
  [ ] choose color pairs for gradients 
    [ ] Dry out the code
    [ ] Is there a way to write a function to make the defs for a given path?
  
  [ ] test out more sophisticated gradients (eg. more points for a wavy hair gradient)
